# AI-Brain-MRI-Segementation

A deep learning model for automated brain MRI segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks. This model can detect and segment brain tumors, lesions, and analyze white/gray matter boundaries.

## Features

- Automated segmentation of brain MRI scans
- Multi-class tissue classification
- Real-time visualization of segmentation results
- Custom CNN architecture optimized for medical imaging
- Data augmentation specific to MRI processing
- Support for common medical image formats (.nii, .dcm)

## Key Applications

- Tumor detection and segmentation
- White/gray matter boundary analysis
- Lesion identification
- Brain structure analysis
- Medical research and diagnostics

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn
